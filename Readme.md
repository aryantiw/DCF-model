# Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model Analysis - Aegis Logistics
## Model Overview and Structure

This document explains the DCF model created for Aegis Logistics, breaking down its key components, assumptions, and methodology.

## 1. Core Model Parameters

### Key Inputs
- WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital): 12%
- Terminal Growth Rate: 4%
- Projection Period: 5 years
- Tax Rate: 25%

### Historical Data Components
- Revenue trajectory
- EBIT margins
- Depreciation figures
- Capital expenditure
- Working capital changes

## 2. Projection Methodology

### Revenue Projections
The model projects revenue using a 15% growth rate, applied to the last historical revenue figure. This growth assumption is based on:
- Historical growth patterns
- Industry growth expectations
- Company's market position
- Expansion plans

### EBIT and Profitability
- Uses the latest historical EBIT margin
- Maintains consistent operational efficiency
- Accounts for scale benefits

### Capital Investment and Depreciation
- CAPEX: 5% of revenue
- Depreciation: 10% annual growth
- Reflects ongoing maintenance and growth investments

### Working Capital
- Working capital requirement: 2% of revenue
- Accounts for operational needs
- Considers industry standard ratios

## 3. Free Cash Flow Calculation

### Components
1. After-tax EBIT (75% of EBIT)
2. Add: Depreciation
3. Subtract: CAPEX
4. Subtract: Working Capital Changes

### Terminal Value
Calculated using the perpetual growth method:
- Final year FCF × (1 + growth rate) / (WACC - growth rate)
- Reflects long-term sustainable growth

## 4. Valuation Process

### DCF Calculation
1. Project free cash flows for 5 years
2. Calculate terminal value
3. Discount all cash flows to present value
4. Sum up to get enterprise value

### Equity Value Derivation
- Enterprise Value
- Less: Net Debt (₹1,000 crores)
- Divided by: Shares Outstanding (350 million)
- Equals: Price per Share

## 5. Key Assumptions and Sensitivity Areas

### Critical Factors
1. Revenue Growth Rate
2. EBIT Margins
3. WACC
4. Terminal Growth Rate
5. Capital Investment Requirements

### Sensitivity Considerations
- Impact of changing growth rates
- Margin variations
- Cost of capital adjustments

## 6. Model Limitations and Considerations

### Data Reliability
- Historical data accuracy
- Future projection uncertainty
- Market condition changes

### External Factors
- Industry dynamics
- Regulatory environment
- Competition
- Economic conditions

## 7. Using the Model

### Input Requirements
- Update historical financials
- Adjust growth assumptions
- Modify WACC calculation
- Update shares outstanding and debt

### Output Interpretation
- Enterprise value
- Equity value
- Price per share
- Valuation metrics

## 8. Recommendations for Model Enhancement

### Potential Improvements
1. Detailed working capital analysis
2. Segment-wise projections
3. Scenario analysis
4. Industry-specific adjustments

### Regular Updates
- Quarterly financial updates
- Assumption revisions
- Market condition adjustments

## Conclusion

This DCF model provides a structured approach to valuing Aegis Logistics. The model's effectiveness depends on the accuracy of inputs and the validity of assumptions. Regular updates and sensitivity analysis are recommended for maintaining model relevance.
